# integral value

## Description

This is a basic code to calculate integral value it stands upon the reimann formula
(reimann sum) the result may not be exact value because of the value of 'n' couldn't be infinit on real world.

## how to test 

- define your funtion inside code.
- set the interval of the function.
- set the 'n' the heighest possible to get the most approximate value.
- make sur the function is continue of the current interval.
 ## how to run
. **compile and run**

    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o main
    ./main
    ```
